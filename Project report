Project Progress Summary

What I Did

UI Overhaul: Redesigned the interface for a more modern and visually appealing look, including smooth animations.
Authentication & Roles: Fixed the login system and implemented a role hierarchy (guest, user, representative/moderator, admin) with unique permissions for each.
UI Bug Fixes: Resolved issues such as the profile window opening in the wrong place, infinite stacking of modals, and dark mode toggling bugs.
Admin Features: Added an admin login (username: admin, password: admin) with full permissions and an admin panel for editing universities and managing user data.
User Experience: Improved navigation and transitions for a smoother user experience.

Whatâ€™s Missing / To Improve

Navigation Links: Some buttons still redirect to the main page instead of their intended destinations.
Database Completeness: The university database is not fully populated, though the app works with the current data.
Security & OAuth: No real security or Google account integration yet; current authentication is basic and for demonstration only.
Notifications: Real-time notifications are not implemented due to the lack of backend and OAuth.
Minor CSS Issues: A few UI elements still need additional styling.

APIs/Tools Used:

Vanilla JavaScript (modular, ES6+)
LocalStorage for data persistence
FontAwesome for icons
No external backend or third-party APIs yet

What Succeeded:

Role-based access control works as intended.
Admin panel allows editing universities and user data.
UI is responsive and interactive.

What Failed or Needs Work:

Some navigation and UI elements need further refinement.
Security and real authentication are not implemented.
Database and notification features are not production-ready.
